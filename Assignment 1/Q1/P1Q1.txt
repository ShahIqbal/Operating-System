P1Q1 - 

Uniprogramming systems allows only one program to be present in memory at a time. This means since one program is only loaded the size in the
memory is small as well. The single program that is present in the memory at the time gets access to all the resources. Whereas 
in multiprogramming, multiple programs can be present in the memory at a given time. Resources are dynamically allocated and 
size of the memory is much larger compared to uni programming. Time sharing is a logical extension of multiprogramming where time-sharing
incorporates a technique where multiple users can log in a computer system at the same time to use it. The objective of this system is 
to minimize response time. The operating system uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time.
